# MenuMission
A tool for putting Mission Control and/or Launchpad buttons in your Menu Bar

As a Mac user, I use Mission Control and Launchpad dozens of times a day. There have been app icons for both of these tools since Lion when they were introduced, meaning you can put the icons in the Dock and launch them from there. However, there has never been an option to put icons in the Menu bar for these thingsâ€”Until now. 

I wanted this because I like to keep as little as possible in my Dock and I realized that Siri has a Dock icon and a menu bar icon, but Launchpad and Mission Control don't and I didn't think that was fair

The program is very simple and does exactly what it says. It will let you put 1 (or more) icons in the Menu Bar that will activate either Mission Control or Launchpad when clicked. You can choose which one will active by right clicking the icon. You can also choose to add additional buttons which so you can have both a Mission Control button and a Launchpad button in your menu bar. You can remove buttons (as long as you have more than 1) and quit the app all together. 

There is currently no built in option for starting at Login, however you can add the app to the Login Items section of Users and Groups in System Preferences and this will open it at login. 

The app will remember how many buttons you had and what they were set to activate when you open it. 

Here you can see the two icons on the far left are the Launchpad and Mission Control icons respectively

Here you can see one of the icons with the right click menu open displaying all the possible options

The app uses SF Symbols so it requires macOS Big Sur or later but looks great in dark and light modes and with any wallpaper!
